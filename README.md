# DesktopBackground
An unfinished program that runs underneath all other programs to simulate a dynamic desktop. No plans on finishing.

Anyone has any desire to use any part of this project is more than welcome to.

I would like to note that the darksouls gif is not my art and was made by ZedoTagger (http://zedotagger.tumblr.com/post/120670458690/did-this-partially-as-background-and-lighting)

The two regions at the top of MainForm.cs are also not my code and were found on a stack overflow post that I have since lost.
